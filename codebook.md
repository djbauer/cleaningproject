## Codebook for meansoutput.csv - Section 1/2
The section of information below is copied from the features_info.txt provided with the original data set to provide background and context. **A section follows that explains the new and included variables.**

>Feature Selection
>=================
>
>The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.
>
>Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag).
>
>Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals).
>
>These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors.

## Codebook for meansoutput.csv - Section 2/2
This file is output by the run_analysis.R script and includes the following variables. Per the assignment instructions only variables of mean and standard deviation values were selected for analysis. The *subject* and *activity* factor variables were added for grouping purposes. Other than *subject* and *activity*, all variables are numeric.

### **Factor variables**
* subject
  - Factor variable of subject number (1-30)

* activity
  - Factor variable of activity with six levels: walking, upstairs, downstairs, sitting, standing, laying

### **Numeric variables; refer to information above for further explanation provided by the researchers. However, note that all numeric variables in meansoutput.csv report the average value for a given participant demonstrating a given activity, across trials**
